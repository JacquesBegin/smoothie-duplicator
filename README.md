# SmoothieDuplicator

The Smoothie Duplicator application is designed to be an admin/user portal for interacting with a smoothie ordering system. The ideal outcome is;

### Admin Portal
* Admin can view a list of most popular smoothies (based off of ordering data)
* Admin can view all available smoothies
* Admin can view a detailed view of individual smoothies: listing ingredients and basic nutritional information
* Admin can search for smoothies using a live search
* Admin can create new smoothies that will be available on the user portal
* Admin can create new ingredients for smoothie creation
* Admin can modifiy smoothie data (name, ingredients)
* Admin can delete smoothies
* Admin can view the number of times a smoothie was ordered

### User Portal
* Users can view a list of most popular smoothies (based off of ordering data)
* Users can view all available smoothies
* Users can view a detailed view of individual smoothies: listing ingredients and basic nutritional information
* Users can search for smoothies using a live search
* Users can build their own smoothie using predefined ingredients
* Users can select single/multiple items to add to an order
* Users can place an order to be processed (current version of app is not designed for monetary exchange or order processing, it is a portal for building an order only)



## Changing the Database 

This project is being developed using the MEAN stack. However, the database can be switched out by;

1. Step 1: Creating a new connection file (specific to the new database)
1. Step 2: Creating a database query file that follows the key/value pairing style of mongodbQueries.js (keys in the new file must match the keys in the mongo file to avoid altering the express routes)
1. Step 3: Add to dbConnections.js: a require statement for the new connection file and a key/value to reference the require.
1. Step 4: Modifing the database connection call in server.js to use the key created in step 2 (i.e. replace "mongoDbConnection" in  "database.mongoDbConnection.connectToServer(<.........>)"




# Known Issues

* Data for all smoothies is being fetched twice when loading dashboard and smoothies component.

* GitHub is alerting that there is a vulnerability in the hoek dependency. Recommended resolution is to update the package to a version of 4.2.1 or greater.
